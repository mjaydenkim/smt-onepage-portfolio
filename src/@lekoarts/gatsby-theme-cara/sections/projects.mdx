## About

Hey guys, I'm Matthew! My pronouns are he/him. Some of my favorite hobbies are reviewing music (duh), playing video games (currently playing a lot of Fall Guys, which I suck at), speedcubing (I'm sub-10 on 3x3, and here's my [best average on camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gio-ATwqN5k)), and following news and politics, especially in the US (please make it stop). My favorite artist is Porter Robinson. I am a member of the Nuraphone master race (they're seriously good headphones, get them if you're looking for nice cans) and the Yang Gang (he should've won). My 2 favorite albums of all time are Porter Robinson's *Worlds* and Kero Kero Bonito's *Time 'n' Place*, and I'm always on the lookout for good new music!
